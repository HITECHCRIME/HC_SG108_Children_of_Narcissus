## Lyrics

```

[CHORUS]
always keeping out children of narcissus 
staging life pretenders twisted benders of mind 
gaslight running out, here to take a lesson
so concealed and subtle brujas 
casting spelled opinions
till i’m rigged and raptured
there were days when i gave my soul
returned damn wrecked, maybe not intended 
but they knew side (the) effects
sliced through the neck with thoughts 
bleeding straight to cup of things 
you let me do, now i’m spilling that 

[VERSE]
there were days when i gave my soul
returned damn wrecked, maybe not intended 
but they knew side (the) effects
sliced through the neck with thoughts 
bleeding straight to cup of things 
you let me do, now i’m spilling that 

there were days when i gave my soul
returned damn wrecked, maybe not intended 
but they knew side (the) effects
sliced through the neck with thoughts 
bleeding straight to cup of things 
you let me do, now i’m spilling that 

till i’m out and free

[CHORUS]
always keeping out children of narcissus 
staging life pretenders twisted benders of mind 
gaslight running out, here to take a lesson
so concealed and subtle brujas 
casting spelled opinions
till i’m rigged and raptured

## Lyrics

```
always keeping out 
children of narcissus 
staging life pretenders 
twisted benders of mind 

gaslight running out 
here to take a lesson
so concealed and subtle
brujas casting spelled opinions
till i’m rigged and outta picture

there were days 
when i gave my soul
returned damn wrecked
maybe not intended 
but they knew the effects, 

sliced through the neck
with thoughts 
bleeding straight to cup
of thing you made me do

now i’m spilling that 

till i’m out and free

the 



```
